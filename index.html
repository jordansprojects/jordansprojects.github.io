	<h2 style="text-align:center"> About Me </h2>
	<p style = "text-align:center"> I was working in auto repair and intended for that to be my career. I took a C++ programming course and came to the realization that programming is extremely fun. I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science. Along the way, I realized how fascinating Mathematics is- so I decided to minor in it. I enjoy problem solving and puzzles, and I think it is amazing that we can automate machines to solve them for us.

	<p style = "text-align:center"> On my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1awb19rDm3H7W1tEt5VvQA"> YouTube Channel</a>, I like to post clips of my projects. Some of them are simply little programs I was making to learn a skill, and others are larger projects.</p>

	<p style = "text-align:center"> I created <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNPRt0aqULn2ol0sqoTlUyjcyL-BtfoXE"> a playlist </a> that demonstrates more completed works that I have created for school assignments. I always want to improve upon my projects, so I have a difficult time ever considering them fully complete. </p>

        <h2>On The Farm : Virtual Reality Tower Defense Game</h2>
        <p class="title">Implemented in Unity Game Engine using Steam VR</p>
        <p>This game was created as a final project for a Virtual Reality class at my university. We implemented this game using C# scripts, Emerald AI and VRIF </p>

        <h2>8-Puzzle Solver & Game</h2>
        <p class="title">An Interactive 8-Puzzle Game and Solver with an Animated Goblin</p>
        <p>For a data structures class in community college, we had to create a project using  the graph data structure. Luckily, graph theory is incredibly interesting and we were barely scratching the surface in this course. This program utilizes a graph search to solve 8-Puzzle.  </p>

        <h2>ChAIckers 2 (In Progress) </h2>
        <p class="title">Checker playing AI inspired by Alpha Zero</p>
        <p>ChAIckers was a project for a Deep Learning course at my University. We successfully created a Deep Learning model that can play checkers, but the final result did not utilize the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm like we had originally intended. The move generation was too slow, so it was impractical trying to include it. Unsatisfied with the original result, I wanted to refactor it by improving upon the move generation code, writing my own monte carlo tree search library, and redoing the deep learning model so that it more closely resembles the Alpha Zero agent. </p>
