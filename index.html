<section class="about_me">

    <h3>Hello, I'm Jordan.</h3>
    <p> I currently work as a software engineer, primarily specializing in test
      automation.
      I like to solve problems and create. Both pastimes are very fufilling in my personal and professional life.</p>
    <p> For the past year or so, I have been helping out a family friend with an ecommerce project. Most of my "freetime coding"
      has been spent on that. It has been fun and a great learning experience, though I am really looking forward to applying what I've learned into making more games.
    </p>
    <p> In the meantime, I hope you enjoy taking a look at projects below. I have improved a lot since creating these. I
      hold an appreciation for them despite how simple and crude some of them are. They all were really fun to make and I learned a lot in the process.
    </p>

        <p>Google Docs extension made to encourage scientists to write papers by gamifying the process.
          You collect points by typing a lot of words, and other possible productivity markers such as time spent
          looking at the document. These points can then be used in mini games.
          We implemented this extension by using the Google Apps Scripts ecosystem, as part of a project for a software
          engineering course I took for my undergrad.
